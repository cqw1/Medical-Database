FullProof
=========

A javascript-based fulltext search engine library.

Fullproof provides a full stack of components for managing a search engine in javascript.

Its main features are:

* Boolean and Scoring search engines available, depending on the kind of search your application needs
* Automatic HTML5 storage detection, and graceful degradation, with a configurable constraint-based capabilities system. Currently manages WebSQL, IndexedDB and Memory data storage.
* Full unicode support and normalization, diacritical marks removal, stemming and phonetical algorithms (currently available for english and french)
* Configurable and very easely extensible parsing and token normalization system
* Easy to integrate, zero external dependency, ~100k minified

Note that fullproof is NOT a document management system, it does only one thing: provide fulltext search to your application, it does not aim at storing documents or data.
