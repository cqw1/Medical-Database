Comments from Crannel:
	Doesn't want the serial number.
	Change "Model" to "Manufacturer" but keep both columns (both model and manufacturer I think)
	Upload more PDF's (i.e. be able to have a "User Manual" and "Service Manual" column)
	Be able to search for PDF title
	Have a link so the user can upload more files
	If we don't have the PDF for something, state "Currently unavailable." or something
	Display all entries on startup
